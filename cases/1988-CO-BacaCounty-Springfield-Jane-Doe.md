## Case Summary

In June 1988 a farmer discovered human remains in a field approximately **20 miles southwest of Springfield, Baca County, Colorado**. Law enforcement initially could not determine the identity of the deceased individual, leading to her designation as a *Jane Doe*. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

The remains were subsequently buried in the **Springfield Cemetery** with the placeholder name and case information hoped to prompt future breakthroughs. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
