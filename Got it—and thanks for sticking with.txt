Got it—and thanks for sticking with this.

Short version: your ChatGPT account can have GitHub connected while this specific GPT (Cold Case Scraper) still isn’t using that connection in this chat. The instructions are fine—the connector just isn’t attached here.

Here’s the fastest way to get me committing directly:

Quick checklist (2–3 mins)

In GPT Builder → open Cold Case Scraper

Go to Configure → Actions.

Under Connected services, make sure GitHub shows up and is enabled for this GPT (not just in your global settings).

Permissions

The GitHub connection should have scopes that cover private repos: repo, contents:write, and ideally workflow.

If wingnut9999/Cipher-GPT-repo is private or under an org, open GitHub → Settings → Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps (or Installed GitHub Apps) and confirm the app has access to that repo specifically. If the org is involved, an owner may need to approve repository access for the app.

Refresh the session

After confirming the above, start a new chat with Cold Case Scraper. (Connectors sometimes only activate on new sessions.)

If all three are true, I’ll be able to: pull → merge → commit the case file and auto-update _index.json (or use the Action below so you never touch _index.json again).

If you want “no manual edits” now

Even before the connector is sorted, add this one GitHub Action once and forget _index.json forever:

Create: .github/workflows/cases-index.yml

Paste the workflow I shared earlier (it scans cases/*.md, reads front matter, and rebuilds /cases/_index.json automatically on every push).

After that, you (or I, once connected) only add .md files; the index updates itself.

What I can do right now

I’ll keep producing repo-ready .md files with correct YAML + a JSON snippet (so your Action can regenerate the index cleanly).

As soon as you confirm the connector is active in Actions → Connected services for this GPT, I’ll push this Missouri River Killer case to wingnut9999/Cipher-GPT-repo and verify the index update path you prefer (direct write or Action-driven).

If you want, I can also give you a tiny “sanity test” commit command you can run once to confirm the Action rebuilds _index.json—totally optional.

Whatever you choose, you won’t be hand-editing multiple files per case.
